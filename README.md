# OVRSGHT
Drone related projekt utilizing Artifical Intelligence and OpenCV

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani & Vladyslav Kharechko <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: A fun projekt inspired by modern day drone technology <br />
Projekt Name: Porjekt OVRSGHT <br />
Start Date: March 12, 2023 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. 
This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
