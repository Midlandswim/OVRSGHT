# OVRSGHT
Drone pProjekt Utilizing Artifical Intelligence and OpenCV

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani & Vladyslav Kharechko <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: A fun projekt inspired by modern day drone technology <br />
Projekt Name: Projekt OVRSGHT <br />
Start Date: March 12, 2023 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This projekt was inspired by the natural disaster afflicting coastal regions, in which efficent/quick search and rescue was pertitent in saving lives. The goal of this porjekt was to use artifical intelligence, visual processing, and drone technology to locate and identify victims, helping search and rescue teams to quickly and effictly address the issue at hand. Using the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 and later a custom designed drone, OpenCV processing software, and Artficially Intelligent pattern recognition, this projekt would be succesful. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
