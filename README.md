# OVRSGHT
Drone Procekt Utilizing Artificial Intelligence and OpenCV

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: A fun project inspired by modern-day drone technology <br />
Project Name: Project OVRSGHT <br />
Start Date: March 12, 2023 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This project was inspired by the natural disaster afflicting coastal regions, in which efficient/quick search and rescue were pertinent in saving lives. The goal of this project was to use artificial intelligence, visual processing, and drone technology to locate and identify victims, helping search and rescue teams quickly and efficiently address the issue at hand. Using the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 and later a custom-designed drone, OpenCV processing software, and artificially intelligent pattern recognition, this project would be successful. This project has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, it continues until the idea is forgotten, and I hope that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
